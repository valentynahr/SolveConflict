          <h1>Notre Dame Cathedral</h1>
          <p>
            One of the most enduring symbols of Paris: Notre-Dame de Paris, also
            known as Notre Dame, a Roman Catholic cathedral is located on the
            eastern half of the Ile de la Cit√©. It is widely considered one of
            the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in France and
            Europe. Begun in 1163 and completed in 1345, this cathedral is a
            sight with its portals surrounded by his many sculptures and
            gargoyles that adorn the roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            We advise you to walk around the cathedral, then go inside and climb
            the 387 steps to the top of the towers. The climb to the top of the
            towers can be exhausting, but you will get a panoramic view of the
            region and see the famous gargoyles up close.
