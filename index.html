        <h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
        <p>
          What would Paris be without its symbolic Eiffel Tower? Built by
          Gustave Eiffel to commemorate the centenary of the French
          Revolution, it is presented at the Exposition Universelle in Paris
          in 1889. 324 meters high, it is one of the most visited monuments in
          the world with nearly 7 million visitors a year.

          The first floor houses the Eiffel Tower 58 which extends over two
          levels, 58 meters above the ground as its name suggests. On the
          second floor, the view is the best at 115 meters because you have a
          diving view on the ground below. Finally on the 3rd floor at 275
          meters, you can see what the office of Gustave Eiffel was. For the
          more adventurous one, it is possible to use the stairs and climb the
          steps (1,665 to the summit).
